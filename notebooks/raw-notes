looking for features in radio waves ... 

From papers I've read, here is what I'm gathering:

cyclic-moments: O'Shea
	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04105.pdf

cyclic-cumulants: Spooner's response to O'Shea (directly commenting on his paper above)
	https://cyclostationary.blog/2017/01/31/machine-learning-and-modulation-recognition-comments-on-convolutional-radio-modulation-recognition-networks-by-t-oshea-j-corgan-and-t-clancy/
